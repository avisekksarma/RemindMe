A browser extension to remind tasks to you on a scheduled time.

Very **handy** for anyone to keep tasks aside while working on something.

Currently only supported on firefox: Download [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/remindmetask/)

Since chromium based browsers and firefox have some compatibility issues, I will look on to that in version 2 maybe.

Contributor's guide: Feel free to do some tests, then maybe add issue and/or make a pull request.

*Would be great if someone makes some design/ui changes,since its not that great now*

##### Note: 

There may be similar extensions in chrome based browsers but I didn't find much to my need in firefox.
And yeah, you got to use browser for the developer by the developer.
