A firefox extension to remind tasks to you on a scheduled time.

Very **handy** for anyone to keep tasks aside while working on something.

##### Note: 

There may be similar extensions in chrome based browsers but I didn't find much to my need in firefox.
And yeah, you got to use browser for the developer by the developer.
